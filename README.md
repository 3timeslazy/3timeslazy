Usually busy with full-time job as a backend engineer, so mostly experimenting with random stuff rather than making projects.

Some of my activities:
- **[ferret](https://github.com/MontFerret/ferret)**: one of the core contributors.
- **[anti-dig](https://github.com/3timeslazy/anti-dig)**: a tiny library that help you to remove Uber's DI framework from your code.
- **[crdt-over-fs](https://github.com/3timeslazy/crdt-over-fs)**: experimenting with local-first synchronization using file system and CRDT. Hope to make it a real library one day.
-  **[vscodium-devpodcontainers](https://github.com/3timeslazy/vscodium-devpodcontainers)**: open source DevContainers extension for VS Codium backed by [DevPod](https://github.com/loft-sh/devpod).
-  **Home server**: Self-hosting some services due to privacy and data ownership reasons.
